# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the user interface and user experience of the meeting minutes transcription application. The current system has multiple studio versions, complex interfaces, and inconsistent navigation patterns that need to be streamlined into a cohesive, user-friendly experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a unified and intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate between different features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide a single, consistent navigation structure across all pages
2. WHEN a user navigates between features THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency and familiar interaction patterns
3. WHEN a user accesses any studio functionality THEN the system SHALL present a single, consolidated studio interface instead of multiple versions
4. IF a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL provide clear breadcrumbs and navigation context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a streamlined transcription workflow, so that I can quickly upload files and get results without navigating complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to transcribe audio THEN the system SHALL provide a simple, step-by-step workflow
2. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL show clear progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL present results in an organized, scannable format
4. IF a user wants advanced features THEN the system SHALL provide progressive disclosure without overwhelming the basic workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive design across all devices, so that I can use the application effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on any device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately for the screen size
2. WHEN a user interacts with controls on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interface elements
3. WHEN a user views transcription results on mobile THEN the system SHALL optimize text readability and navigation
4. IF a user switches between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality across all platforms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual hierarchy and information architecture, so that I can quickly find and understand the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes
2. WHEN a user scans content THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy with appropriate headings and sections
3. WHEN a user needs to take action THEN the system SHALL make primary actions visually prominent and secondary actions subtle
4. IF a user encounters errors or warnings THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate visual treatment and clear messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want efficient dashboard and overview screens, so that I can quickly understand my usage, recent activity, and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics and recent activity in a scannable format
2. WHEN a user views usage information THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of limits and consumption
3. WHEN a user wants to start a new transcription THEN the system SHALL provide prominent, accessible entry points
4. IF a user has recent transcriptions THEN the system SHALL display them with relevant metadata and quick actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a clean and organized admin interface, so that I can efficiently manage users and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses admin features THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated admin interface separate from user features
2. WHEN an admin manages users THEN the system SHALL provide efficient bulk operations and filtering capabilities
3. WHEN an admin monitors system health THEN the system SHALL display key metrics in an organized dashboard format
4. IF an admin needs to perform critical actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate confirmation and safety measures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and accessible interaction patterns, so that I can use the application efficiently regardless of my technical expertise or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with any interface element THEN the system SHALL provide consistent behavior and feedback
2. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard accessibility
3. WHEN a user relies on screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
4. IF a user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast and support high contrast modes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive interactions, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for slow page loads or interface updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL load content within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN a user interacts with interface elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN a user uploads files THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress and allow background processing
4. IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle slow connections with appropriate loading states
