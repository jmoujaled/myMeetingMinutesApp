## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with backend infrastructure (database, APIs) before frontend components
- Build core functionality first, then add enhancements and optimizations
- Test each component in isolation before integration
- Use TypeScript throughout for type safety and better developer experience

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for search and large dataset handling

### Dependencies
- React Query for server state management
- Zod for runtime type validation
- date-fns for date manipulation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Headless UI for accessible components
- jsPDF for PDF generation
- docx for Word document creation

### Success Criteria
- Users can view all their transcriptions and meetings in one place
- Search and filtering work efficiently with large datasets
- Export functionality works reliably for all supported formats
- Mobile experience is smooth and touch-friendly
- Page loads quickly and handles errors gracefully
- Integration with existing features is seamless
